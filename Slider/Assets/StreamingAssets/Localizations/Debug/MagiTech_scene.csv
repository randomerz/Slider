"Slider.v1.0.13","Unity.v2022.3.44f1","(file format explainer)->","Localization files are formatted like CSV so they can be easily edited,
however formatting has strict rules for easy parsing. Most of these rules
are already handled by Excel / Libre / etc., so you don't have to worry
about them in normal usage. However, if your localization file seems to
be corrupted, these rules may be helpful for debugging purposes...
- The first 4 rows can be arbitrarily long
  - The first cell of first row is used to store this block of instruction
    text
  - The first 3 cells of the fourth row is used as headers
  - All other cells in the first and fourth rows are ignored
  - Columns in the second row alternate between property and value (ex.
    ' foo | 1 | bar | 3.5 | ... '
    - Any whitespaces before and after the property name are ignored
  - Columns in the third row are exclusively comments for properties in the
    second row
- Every following line can include any number of cells, but only the
  first four will be parsed (you can use the rest as comments if needed)
  - The fourth column is an optional metadata column
