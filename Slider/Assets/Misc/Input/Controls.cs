/// and <see cref="Bindings"/> to access them. Note that you do not need to use <see cref="LoadBindings"/> unless you have
/// changed the bindings stored in PlayerPrefs in your code.

/// When assigning functionality to bindings, first assign them to a variable in your class: InputSettings bindings = Controls.Bindings
